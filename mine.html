In 2000 it was proven that solving unknown values in minesweeper from known values is NP-complete. 
Some parts of this proof are available
<a href="http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.W.Kaye/minesw/minesw.pdf">online</a>. This sketch describes
a polynomial conversion from the NP-hard problem of satisfiability to the minesweeper problem.
<br><br>

However two conditions must be met for a problem to be NP-complete, it must be NP-easy and NP-hard:
<br>

<ul>
<li>NP-easy: There is a polynomial conversion of this problem to a problem in NP.</li>
<li>NP-hard: There is a polynomial conversion of a problem in NP to this problem.</li>
</ul>

The NP-easy part of the proof can be sketched with SABR. First we generate objects to define
the number of mines around each number, then we apply those objects to board-cells based
on whether they are a corner, side or middle cell. 
<br><br>

As the size of the board increases, causing the number of DesObj to also increase, the size 
of the CNF file increases at a polynomial rate.
