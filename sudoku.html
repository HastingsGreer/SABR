<h1>Sudoku</h1>

<br><br>

Sudoku is often used as a constraint programming example. Our example is a 4x4 Sudoku.
Transitions are unnessary for the Sudoku problem so we do not state a Start or End and 
instead use Board as the object for Req Board to specify what symbols we know. 
? is used for the symbols we do not know.
<br><br>

To make a constraint like "all different" we can use Req like below:
<br><br>

<div class="mycode">
	Req RowColBlock	{  v !v !v !v }		<br>
	Req RowColBlock	{ !v  v !v !v }		<br>
	Req RowColBlock	{ !v !v  v !v }		<br>
	Req RowColBlock	{ !v !v !v  v }
</div>
