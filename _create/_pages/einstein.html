<h1>Einstein's Puzzle</h1>

<a href="http://www.brain-fun.com/Brain-Teasers/EinsteinsRiddle.php"><img src="/img/ein.jpg"/></a>
<br><br>

Einstein's puzzle, stated <a href="http://www.brain-fun.com/Brain-Teasers/EinsteinsRiddle.php">here</a>, is a 
classic constraint problem. In common with Sudoku, it does not use transitions and uses the "all different"
design pattern.
<br><br>

This puzzle also utilizes multiple symbol lists. After creating a symbol list with a name, you can specify
that a board cell uses that symbol list by stating board-cell:symbol-list-name. It is invalid to connect
one symbol list to another using a temporary variable.
<br><br>

Here we also utilize Opt, which stands for Option. For instance we can state that either the object House
indicates the Englishman is in a red house, or the nationality and house have other values than
Englishman and red. These groups of options (opt-groups) are formed using the option name. We continue in 
this vein for all the rules to properly model the problem.
<br><br>

<div class="mycode">
	Opt cl1:House {  red  Englishman ? ? ? }	<br>
	Opt cl1:House { !red !Englishman ? ? ? }
</div>
