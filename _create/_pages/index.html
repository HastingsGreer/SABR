<h1>About</h1>

SABR (Spatial and Action Based Resolver) is a constraint programming language designed with an emphasis on spatial and temporal logic.
<br><br>

Programs compile to CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form), which is then solved by a CNF solver, whose results 
are processed into human readable form.
<br><br>

The goal of the language is to make representing puzzles and operations research problems not just possible, but also 
intuitive and the solving of these problems efficient. 
<br><br>
		
From a theoretical perspective, the language can also be used to prove a problem is NP-Easy and can be used to verify 
properties about automata and systems that can be modeled as automata such as circuits and programs.
