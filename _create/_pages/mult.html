Since so much of modern <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography>cryptography</a> is based on the complexity of factoring primes, few theoretical math results could have as immediate and devastating effect as a polynomial
solution to factoring. Factoring has not been proven as NP-complete. However, it is NP-easy
meaning that if it turns out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem">P=NP</a>
this little program could cause widespread devastation.
<br><br>

In our example we factor the number 9. To do this we set up the board similar to how multiplication
for an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit">ALU</a> would be set up. 
All numbers are represented in binary and simple multiplication (single binary 
number from bottom row * top row) and addition are performed using Opt simultaneously. As can be seen
in the solution file, 9 (1001) factors to 3 (011) and 3 (011).
