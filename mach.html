<a href="http://machinarium.net/demo/">Machinarium</a> is a puzzle adventure game with a lot of interesting puzzles, 
some of which are amenable to constraint programming. The first in game sub-puzzle you face is three interlocking 
circles in a <a href="img/tri.jpg">triangle</a> shape. The goal is to move the circles left and right until all the
greens form an equilateral triangle. 
<br><br>

This puzzle is similar to the river cross puzzle. However, board has the cosmetic additions of ; for line
endings and . for spaces. Also here we demonstrate that you don't need to state the object explicitly,
an implicit declaration works as well.
