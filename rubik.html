<h1>Rubik's Cube</h1>

<br><br>

Solving a fully or partially scrambled Rubik's cube is another very hard problem. However,
the setup is simple and follows the same form as the machinarium puzzle. 
<br><br>

Board indicates all of the sides, Start indicates the scramble, and End indicates the 
solution. Trans operates over a side object and can be clockwise or counter clockwise.
The side object has a DesObj for each Rubik's Cube side.
<br><br>

It has been proven via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube#Optimal_solutions">intelligent brute-force</a> that at most 20 moves are needed to solve a 
Rubik's Cube from any start position. So the number of stages input parameter can 
always be below 20.
